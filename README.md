# BubbleTeaOrdering
This program models the ordering of bubble tea, allowing users to select the type of tea, toppings and milk. A combination of elements such as Radio Buttons, CheckBoxes, Drop Down Menu, Buttons and Tables have been used to implement this program. After the drink has been prepared, it appears at the bottom in the form of a table.
